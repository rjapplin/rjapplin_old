I'm Jacob Applin. At the moment, I'm currently hacking my way as a first-year
economics Ph.D. student at the University of Kentucky. I hold a B.S. in
Economics with minors in math and history from Murray State University
(2017; *Summa Cum Laude*) and an MA in Applied Economics with a concentration
in mathematics from Western Kentucky University (2019) where I was
the outstanding graduate student of the Gordon Ford College of Business.
